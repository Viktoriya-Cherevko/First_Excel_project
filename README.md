🛒 Supermarket Sales Dashboard Project (Excel)
This was my first Excel dashboard project. I focused on visualizing:

Customer Profile: using pivot tables and charts to explore demographics, purchase behavior, and preferences.

Financial Overview: showing total sales, average ratings, gross income, and trends across cities, branches, and payment types.

📌 Dataset
I found the dataset online. Unfortunately, it contains some inconsistencies and unrealistic values (e.g., strange date sequences, mismatched totals). I chose to work with the original data to practice cleaning, pivoting, and building dashboards without modifying the source.

🧩 Structure
supermarket_sales: Original dataset with transaction-level data.

PT Customers: Pivot table summarizing customer information.

Dashboard customers: Dashboard visualizing customer demographics and trends.

PT Sales: Pivot table summarizing financial metrics.

Dashboard sales: Dashboard visualizing total income, daily sales, and ratings.
